### A-Star-Path-Traversal
Simple path traversal example using A*

Basic implementation of A* algorithm on a basic grid.

It uses euclidean distance as the heuristic.

The two file contain one for a grid world and a second for grid world where y next < y prev is not allowed.

Input of the world is achieved through a yaml file. A sample is added.
